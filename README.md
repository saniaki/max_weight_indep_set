# Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS)
A dynamic programming algorithm for computing a maximum-weight independent set of a path graph.  

This file describes the weights of the vertices in a path graph (with the weights listed in the order in which vertices appear in the path). It has the following format:  
[number_of_vertices]  
[weight of first vertex]  
[weight of second vertex]
